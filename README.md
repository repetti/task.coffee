This is just some simple project...

Some moments were not clear from the task, so...

## Assumptions

System - the whole workaround
Programmer - the person making most of actions
Coffee machine - the machine producing coffee, allowing 2 programmers to work with it at the same time

* the favourite coffee will be assigned to each Programmer randomly
* cash or electronic payment method will be defined randomly per Programmer
* 10 programmers can pick the coffee at the same time (10 per System)
* 5 programmers can simultaneously pay for the coffee (5 per System)
* 2 programmers can simultaneously obtain coffee from the machine (2 per Machine)
* all Programmers start obtaining coffee at the same time, get one cup of drink and leave
* Number of machines is undefined but more than 1 => lets assume there are 10 machines
* Java 1.7 is used
* All Programmers are female ("her" coffee) :)
